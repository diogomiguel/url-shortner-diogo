## Overview

Configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3000`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.

To prevent any issues with CORS, the user's browser will communicate exclusively with the Webpack development server.

This request is made to `localhost:3000`, the Webpack dev server. Webpack will infer that this request is actually intended for our API server. We specify in `package.json` that we would like Webpack to proxy API requests to `localhost:3001`:

Therefore, the user's browser makes a request to Webpack at `localhost:3000` which then proxies the request to our API server at `localhost:3001`:

This setup uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) for process management. Executing `npm start` instructs `concurrently` to boot both the Webpack dev server and the API server.

## Deploying

### Background

Inside `server.js`, we tell Node/Express we'd like it to serve static assets in production:

```
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static('client/build'));
}
```

You just need to have Webpack produce a static bundle of the React app (below).

### Heroku

**0. Setup your Heroku account and Heroku CLI**

For installing the CLI tool, see [this article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).

**1. Build the React app**

Running `npm run build` creates the static bundle which we can then use any HTTP server to serve:

```
cd client/
npm run build
```

**2. Commit the `client/build` folder to source control**

From the root of the project:

```
git add client/build
git commit -m 'Adding `build` to source control'
```

**3. Create the Heroku app**

```
heroku apps:create food-lookup-demo
```

**4. Push to Heroku**

```
git push heroku master
```

Heroku will give you a link at which to view your live app.
