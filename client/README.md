## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

The tools used by Create React App are subject to change.
Currently it is a thin layer on top of many amazing community projects, such as:

* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) with ES6 and extensions used by Facebook (JSX, [object spread](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/commits/master), [class properties](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-class-public-fields))
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest)
* and others.

## What Has Been Added?

As React App is not that opinionated, a few tools of my preference have been added, such as:

* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [ReduxSaga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
* [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
* [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
* [StyledComponents](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
* [ReactBootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html) used to make the HTML+CSS tasks easier. Wouldn't use otherwise on an app this size.
* and others.

## What Could Be Improved (not minors)?

* Interface
* Check URL format before submission
* Add Meta - React Helmet
* Cross Browser support
